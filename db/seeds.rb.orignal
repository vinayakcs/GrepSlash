ep.notes="a tale of code and book, make your own publishing platform"
ep.description="Most of us take to blogs to render our thoughts and let the popular platforms do the html for us. Let me direct your kind attention to gitbook.
Here's what they have to say for themselves:
GitBook is a command line tool (and Node.js library) for building beautiful books using GitHub/Git and Markdown.You can publish books easily online using gitbook.io and an editor is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. You can follow @GitBookIO on Twitter. Complete documentation is available at help.gitbook.io.
Another gift from the node fraternity, this really is a cool thing if you are comfortable with little bit of markdown. Also you have the option of having your book as a static website (our own personal blog, responsive too) or a portable format (pdf, ePub, MOBI), all the while using git for version control.
They also have a monetization platform, allowing the authors to distribute their work in prominent marketplaces after putting a price tag to their work.
 Check it out: https://www.gitbook.io and for the code https://github.com/GitbookIO .
 This reminds me of yet another code to book tool called pollen. Developed in racket (that’s a lisp-like language if you havent heard about it before, have a look @ http://racket-lang.org/ )
Pollen has a really good starting guide @ http://mbutterick.github.io/pollen/doc/.

Though it seems like a bit of 're-inventing the wheel' when maven and gradle already exist, which also has plugins for javascript which in turn uses rhino for executing these tasks. But yet these libraries are worth using.
Grunt.js (http://gruntjs.com/) is one of the popular task runner for javascript, though it has a newbie contender called gulp.js (http://gulpjs.com/). gulp.js is somewhat easy to learn as most of its syntax is node style and there is not a lot of preconfiguration.

Bitcoin is an online payment system under control of none, its out their with the community something like torrent, peer to peer. So you begin by getting an address similar to an email address, the only difference is you can send and receive money by it. The complete transactions of all kinds are maintained in a public ledger shared by all. These currencies are spawned as a reward when you 'mine' or when you process the aforementioned transactions and verify the payment by adding them to the public ledger, for which you need to spend some computation or processing powers as it involves a set of cryptographic rules.
For more info have a look https://bitcoin.org/en/how-it-works
With the bitcoin boom and with its continued growth (1 bitcoin is equivalent to 330$ at the time of this writing), its fairly normal for most of us to get a bite of the action. Bitcore can be thought of as an interface to the bitcoin network and provides a set of ready to use functionalities which you can use in your apps. Developed in node for the node stack  , you can easily start by having a quick tour at its example section here https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/blob/master/examples.md

The image can be shipped to any target machine/vm/cloud etc . Its significantly different from VM as VM tries to emulate the hardware (need to ship more data) and, docker just acts as a process(this process sustains the application requirements and interact with the kernel for hardware support) which the target OS handles.
Fig is an orchestration tool providing control in a multi-container service (typical SOA) scenario. All the rules can be mentioned in a single fig.yml file

ep.description="This program applies the Delaunay-based image segmentation, which is a fully
automated process that does not require an initial estimate of number of clusters. The
core idea is to apply Delaunay triangulation to the image histogram instead of the image itself. This reduces the sites required to construct the diagram to merely 255 at most (uint8) resulting in a fast image segmentation.

ep.description="For recognizing objects from large image databases, histogram based methods have proved to be simple and useful in the last decade. For training the algorithm, grayscale images with 256 gray levels are used. Firstly, frequency of every gray-level is computed and stored in vectors for further processing. Secondly, mean of consecutive nine frequencies from the stored vectors is calculated and stored in other vectors for later use in testing phase. The mean vector is used for calculating absolute differences among the mean of trained images and the test image. Finally the minimum difference found identifies the matched class with test image. 
For a better understanding of the working of the algorithm please refer to:

This technique is usually used when you need a 3D model of a small artefact which can be placed on a turntable, allowing dozens, even hundreds of images to be captured from around the object. It has been used pretty successfully by museums and the like to create online virtual galleries.
Each image is just used as a mask or silhouette. A lump of voxel \"clay\" is placed in the middle of the scene and from each image we simply look and see what is outside the object silhouette. Anything outside is carved away. Obviously, this requires us to know where the camera was relative to the object when the picture was taken, which is a whole separate problem."

ep.description="It is a GUI based tool to reduce noise from an audio containing human speech using a custom designed Chebyshev FIR filter. Low-pass filters allow the low frequency components of an input signal to pass through while attenuating (reducing) high frequency components. Measurement noise fall into the high frequency range of the signal spectrum, while the underlying process signal usually lies towards the low frequency end. Thus filters that are used to remove noise from measurements are of the low-pass types."

Then dominant frequency is extracted with FFT and plotted. For use as a voice coach, a few musical notes have been plotted as reference on the frequency scale. In theory it is possible to create any reference sequence, which means that one could learn to sing anything perfectly. There are two other plots, the bottom-left one shows the current filtered signal and a bottom-right one shows the frequency spectrum. These plots give a picture to the user of the signal's composition."

ep.description="This project generates a mosaic image based on a single (usually high resolution) main image, and numerous low resolution tile images. A large mosaic image will be randomly generated from the multiple tile images. The resulting mosaic image will be combined with the main image, forming the desired result. The ratio between strength of the images is defined by the Overlay Ratio ranging between 0 and 1. A smaller value will make the main image more dominant. The user can define regions with different Overlay Ratio values. 
For example, when the main image is a portrait, the Overlay Ratio value around the face should be small (about 0.2), while it can be high (about 0.7) in other less important areas. The user can also resize the final image, sharpen the small images, convert them to color (RGB) or Gray images, if needed. "
